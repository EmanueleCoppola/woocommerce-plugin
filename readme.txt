With Satispay you can send money to friends and pay in stores from your phone. Free, simple, secure! #doitsmart

== Description ==

Satispay is a new mobile payment system that allows users to pay in physical and online stores, send money to friends, as well as top up phone credit; all within a few simple clicks. The app for consumers is intuitive, secure and available for Android, iOS and Windows Phone. 
 
Satispay is not only fast but it also allows you to reduce the cost and increase the security of accepting digital payments making it the ideal solution for businesses. Customers make purchases by simply inserting their IBAN number and confirming the payment request from their smartphone. The simplified process reduces the barriers for consumers resulting in fewer abandoned carts at checkout.
 
In order to activate the service, you must complete the free signup for Satispay Business via the following link: https://business.satispay.com/signup. Joining Satispay is free as there are no activation costs, monthly fees, or deactivation charges. 
 
The only fee is a commission of:
- **0.5%** on payments less than or equal to 10€
- **0.5% + 0.20€** for payments greater than 10€

**Secure**
As an Electronic Money Institution regulated by the FCA, Satispay adheres to elevated standards of security. In addition, having constructed a system based on the IBAN, Satispay is even more secure than traditional credit/debit cards which can be easily cloned or stolen.
 
**Efficient**
Satispay payments are executed in an instant. The system is also extremely efficient in settling payments as the funds received are deposited into your business’ bank account the following business day (T+1).
 
**Manage reimbursement requests quickly and for free**
Manage all of your refund requests directly with the Refund function integrated in the Magento back-office without incurring any additional costs. Your customers will be notified immediately with a message from their app.
 
**Eliminate the risk of chargeback**
As soon as the customer confirms the payment, the transaction is completed, thus eliminating the possibility of chargeback.
