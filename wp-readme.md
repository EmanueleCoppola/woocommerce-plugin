Satispay is a new payment system that allows you to pay stores or friends from your smartphone.

== Description ==

Satispay is a new payment system that allows you to pay stores or friends from your smartphone. To make the service more secure, more efficient and cheaper, we constructed an entirely new platform that is independent from traditional payment methods such as debit and credit cards.

No more percentage based commissions! Payments above €10 cost just €0.20, regardless of the amount, while payments below €10 are free!

Satispay is completely free for personal accounts. There are absolutely no costs for: download, signup, sending and receiving money within the app, or transfers to and from your bank account!

Satispay is available in:
- Italy
